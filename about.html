        <div class="about-me">
            <p>My name is Andrea and improving people lives through design makes me feel good!
                I obtained a diploma in UX design at the UX Design Institute, where I learnt all the fundamental skills
                to create user friendly products.
                â€‹
                I find it incredible how approaching UX changed completely my point of view, not only towards IT
                products, but above all towards the everyday life.
                As a user, I really enjoy when a product helps me, undertands my needs and feels smooth under my clicks.
                As a designer, I want to help people to have a better and easier everyday life, pushing myself to
                understand who they are.
                Users are first and foremost individuals.

                My other great infinite passion is music.
                Indeed, I am also a professional violinist who freelance with major orchestras and teach kids and
                adults, working hard to inspire more and more future musicians.
                And when I take off my concert suit, I enjoy taking up my electric guitar and wandering off passionate
                and smoky blues melodies.
                Everyday, music teaches me how important passion and dedication are.
                Teaching makes me understand how important empathy towards people is.</p>
